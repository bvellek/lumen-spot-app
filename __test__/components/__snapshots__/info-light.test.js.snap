    </h2>

      <span>
        Golden Hour
      </span>
      : the time when the sky is filled with golden red-yellow tones. Diffused light with low contrast has a warming effect on your photos. This magical condition occurs briefly in the morning from the end of civil twilight through the beginning of the sunrise. In the evening you can catch the golden hour toward the end of sunset and into the beginning of civil twilight.

    <p>
      <span>
        Blue Hour
      </span>
      : the time just before golden hour in the morning (beginning of civil twilight) and just after, in the evening (end of civil twilight). The sky’s color will be cool and saturated, filled with deep blue. This can be a great time for urban photography, moon shots, and cool landscapes.

        Twilights
      </span>
